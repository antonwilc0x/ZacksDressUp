# Zack's Dress Up 1Â½

Zack's Dress Up is a basic drag and drop-based dress up game written and designed in Godot 3. It's a partial port and remake of my original Flash game, ZC's Dress Up, that contains all the original assets with only minor edits.

I have high confidence that I'll be able to get around to creating a proper sequel with newer glasses and better game play mechenics.

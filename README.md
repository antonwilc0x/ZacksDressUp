# Tony's Dress Up

![](screenshot.png)

​Tony's Dress Up is a open source dress up game. It's a remake of my original Flash game, ZC's Dress Up, developed back in 2007. I've included the original flash games in the ``/archive`` directory that can be played at [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/)'s demo page.

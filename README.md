# Zack's Dress Up

â€‹Zack's Dress Up is a open source dress up game. It's a remake of my original Flash game, ZC's Dress Up, that contains all the original assets with only minor edits. That version was and remains proprietary due to the nature of Flash, unfortunately.

The biggest change in this remake is moving from drag-and-drop to a [CAS](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Create_a_Sim)-like game mechanic and design. The original port has been moved to it's own branch, under the Classic moniker. I have high confidence that I'll be able to get around to developing a proper sequel with newer graphics.

# Zack's Dress Up 1½

​Zack's Dress Up 1½​  is a basic drag and drop-based dress up game written and designed in Godot 3. It's a port of my original Flash game, ZC's Dress Up, that contains all the original assets with only minor edits.

I have high confidence that I'll be able to get around to developing a proper sequel with newer graphics and better game play mechenics sometime Q1 2019.
